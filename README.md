**Dependencies**

1. Python Libraries: 
- `requests`: for making API calls

- `spotipy`: Spotify API wrapper

- `pandas`: data processing

- `numpy`: numerical operations

- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: vizualizations


2. Sentiment analysis & NLP:

- `vaderSentiment`: Sentiment analysis for short texts
- `textblob`: NLP processing (alternative)
- `transformers` & `torch`: If using deep learning model

3. Environment Variables (for API Keys)
- `python-dotenv`: Stores API keys securely

Awesome! Letâ€™s break this down step by step, from idea to implementation.

## **Step 1: Define the Project Scope & MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Analyze Spotify music listening patterns, determine mood, detect mental health trends, and suggest self-care actions.  
ðŸ”¹ **Key Features for MVP:**  
- Get Spotify listening history.  
- Perform sentiment analysis on song lyrics & audio features.  
- Detect trends in mood over time.  
- Provide personalized self-care recommendations.  
ðŸ”¹ **Tech Stack:**  
- **Data Collection:** Spotify API, Genius API (for lyrics)  
- **Sentiment Analysis & AI:** Python (NLTK, VADER, Hugging Face Transformers)  
- **Data Processing & Storage:** Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory, Synapse Analytics)  
- **Deployment:** Azure ML, Streamlit (optional for UI)

## **Step 2: Set Up the Spotify API & Collect Data**  
### **âœ… Create a Spotify Developer Account & App**  
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).  
2. Log in and create a new app.  
3. Get **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (needed for authentication).  

### **âœ… Authenticate & Get Userâ€™s Listening History**  
- Use **OAuth 2.0** for authentication (users must grant access).  
- Use Spotifyâ€™s **Get Recently Played Tracks** endpoint to fetch listening history.  


- Extract **track names, artists, timestamps, and audio features** (valence, energy, etc.).  
- Store this data in **Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory + Synapse Analytics).**  

---

## **Step 3: Perform Sentiment & Mood Analysis**  
### **âœ… Get Lyrics & Run Sentiment Analysis**  
- Use **Genius API** to fetch lyrics based on song title & artist.  
- Apply NLP models (**VADER, TextBlob, or Transformer models**) to analyze sentiment.  

---

## **Step 4: Detect Mental Health Trends**  
- Store & analyze user mood trends over **days/weeks/months.**  
- Use **time-series analysis** to detect prolonged negative moods.  
- Apply AI/ML to predict **when a user may need self-care recommendations.**  

---

## **Step 5: Generate Personalized Self-Care Recommendations**  
- If a user listens to **sad songs too often**, suggest **uplifting playlists, meditation, or journaling.**  
- If a userâ€™s mood **improves after exercise-related music**, reinforce that behavior.  
- Use **GPT models or rule-based logic** to generate **tailored recommendations.**  

---

## **Step 6: Deploy on Microsoft Fabric & Build a Simple UI**  
- **Use Microsoft Fabric for Data Pipelines:**  
  - **Data Factory** to extract & process Spotify data.  
  - **Synapse Analytics** to store & visualize mood trends.  
- **Build a simple UI with Streamlit (optional)** to display mood patterns & suggestions.  

---

## **Step 7: Testing & Refinement**  
- Test with real users (or your own Spotify history).  
- Improve sentiment analysis with better models.  
- Expand recommendations beyond music (mindfulness apps, AI chatbots, etc.).
